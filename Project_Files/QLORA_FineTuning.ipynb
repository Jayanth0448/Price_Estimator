    "**After Finetuning the model below are the observation**\n",
    "1. Significant Accuracy Improvement\n",
    "\n",
    "Finetuned model achieved 62.8% accuracy, more than 2× better than the base LLaMA model (28%), demonstrating strong task-specific learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Stable and Healthy Training Dynamics\n",
    "\n",
    "Training loss decreased smoothly (1.95 → 1.70), with stable gradient norms and a clean learning-rate warm-up + decay schedule, indicating no training instability.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Efficient LoRA Finetuning\n",
    "\n",
    "LoRA configuration (rank, alpha, dropout) worked effectively, enabling fast and stable training without overfitting—even with only ~0.6 epochs completed.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Proven End-to-End Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "Dataset quality, preprocessing, LoRA setup, and training procedure all aligned well, resulting in a reliable, high-performing finetuned model suitable for real use."
